## COVID-19: Lockdown, the perfect opportunity to use the time we offer you!

Like certainly many of you, I am unfortunately **confined for an indefinite period** in order to reduce the spread of this terrible coronavirus.

Moreover, the project I'm working on at [Decathlon](https://developers.decathlon.com) has just gone into standby and so I now have before me a very rare resource to exploit: time.

In this article, I will therefore share with you **my to do list for this confinement**.
Because yes, this is **the perfect opportunity to do all the things that we usually reject due to lack of time!**

**I hope this will inspire you**, I would be delighted to have **your to do list in comments**, we could **improve this article together :-)**

A lot of cool things to do! 😃 Let's wrap it in a Table Of Contents.

### Reading 📖 <a name="reading"></a>

With the daily grind and the whole of the tasks to be carried out more priority, I always carried over a lot of book that I have to read. 
So here is my program:

- [The Manager's Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33369254-the-manager-s-path) by [Camille Fournier](https://twitter.com/skamille)

### Learning technologies 🤓 <a name="learning-technologies"></a>

This is the perfect time to advance my Trello board ["Learn, learn, learn"](https://trello.com/b/wsPkES9o/learn-learn-learn-%F0%9F%93%96%F0%9F%92%BB%F0%9F%93%B1).

### Working on Open Source projects 💻 <a name="working-open-source-projects"></a>

It's also the perfect time to move forward on open source projects that we love but that we never really have time to look into.
Here are the projects I have planned to contribute during the confinement:

- [Code Notes](https://github.com/lauthieb/code-notes) - A simple code snippet & gist manager for developers built with Electron & Vue.js

### Improving my website 🖥 <a name="improving-website"></a>

I released a week ago [my website](https://lauthieb.dev) created with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). During this confinement I have planned to add my [DEV.to articles](https://dev.to/lauthieb) into my website [lauthieb.dev](https://lauthieb.dev)

[![lauthieb.dev](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1601681934661/HmDpW15qO.png)](https://lauthieb.dev)

For this, I will use the [DEV API (beta)](https://docs.dev.to/api/)

### Improving productivity 🚀 <a name="improving-productivity"></a>

In order to bounce back even faster and be more efficient when I return to work, I will take this opportunity to look at lots of tips regarding productivity:

- [Alfred App](https://www.alfredapp.com/) - Productivity App for macOS
- [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) - A To-do list application
- [Spectacle App](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) - Move and resize windows with ease

### Improving my english 🇬🇧 <a name="improving-engligh"></a>

In my personal development plan, I also plan to improve in English this year, so I will take the opportunity to do this during this confinement.
For that, I will use:

- [Mosalingua](https://www.mosalingua.com/en) - App for learning vocabulary with a Spaced Repetition System
- [TED talks](https://www.ted.com/) - Ideas worth spreading 

### (Remote) family time 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 <a name="remote-family-time"></a>

Confinement is also a time to spend quality time with your family. Whether at home with my spouse or on video with my loved ones, this is my program:

- Watching series & movies on TV, [Netflix](https://netflix.com) or [Amazon Prime Video](https://www.primevideo.com/)
- Sports at home on [Decathlon E Club](https://eclub.decathlon.fr/)
- Visio with family & friends on [Facebook Messenger](https://messenger.com)

### Cooking 🍰 <a name="cooking"></a>

Not necessarily being very strong at the kitchen level, I will take the opportunity to make some recipes in my ["Monsieur Cuisine Connect"](https://www.monsieur-cuisine.com/): 

- [Rigatoni with beef ragout](https://www.monsieur-cuisine.com/en/recipes/detail/rigatoni-with-beef-ragout/)
- [Spicy mince with tomatoes, red pepper and onions](https://www.monsieur-cuisine.com/en/recipes/detail/spicy-mince-with-tomatoes-red-pepper-and-onions/)

- [Apple cake](https://www.monsieur-cuisine.com/en/recipes/detail/apple-cake/)

### Gardening 🍃 <a name="gardening"></a>

March is perfect for working in the garden (if you have one). Here's what I plan to do: remove the weeds, mow the lawn & plant new flowers. What improve me too because I do not necessarily have a green thumb!

### Cleaning & Tidying up 🧽 <a name="cleaning-tidying-up"></a>

It is really time to clean the whole house and put away the famous attic, a task that I have always postponed. Let's go!

### Building things 🛠 <a name="building-things"></a>

Confinement makes me want to build DIY things with simple materials at my disposal! 
Here is what I plan to study:

- [Pallet bottle storage cabinet](https://blog.monmagasingeneral.com/fabriquer-une-etagere-bar-avec-des-palettes/)

- Home Automation with [Google Home](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.chromecast.app) and [Mi Home](https://www.mi.com/fr/mi-home-security-camera-360-1080P/)

### Gaming 🎮 <a name="gaming"></a>

It's also time to have fun while playing! An activity that I rarely do usually: 

- [Animal Crossing™: New Horizons](https://www.animal-crossing.com/new-horizons)
- [The Escapists 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/641990/The_Escapists_2/)

- [Prison Architect](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233450/Prison_Architect)

## Conclusion

Here! As I was able to indicate to you, do not hesitate to share with me what you plan to do during this confinement. This article will be alive and ready to welcome lots of ideas from you!

Finally, I wanted to give my full support to all the nursing staff and to those who work hard so that we can continue to live. 

**Thank you so much ❤️**
