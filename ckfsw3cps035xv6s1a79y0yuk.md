## Code Notes, an open source code snippet manager to increase our productivity! 🚀

Who has never been copying paste a piece of code in a simple notebook? Built with Electron & Vue.js, [Code Notes](https://lauthieb.github.io/code-notes) is the open source & free solution to easily **organize and find your snippets & Github gists**!

Today, through this article, I would like to show its features and since **it's my first open source project** with already **800+ stars** on [GitHub](https://github.com/lauthieb/code-notes) and it's now **1 year old**, I think it's the right time! 😀

# What is Code Notes? 💻

[Code Notes](https://lauthieb.github.io/code-notes) is a software with a lot of features allowing us to increase our productivity everyday. Firstly, let me introduce them with a video!

## Create & update your snippets easily 😎

As you can see, it's pretty easy to save snippets and retrieve them later!
You just have to select a name, a description, some tags to retrieve them easily, add your note by selecting its language and click create! 👌

## Synchronize & manage your GitHub Gists 🎉 

After a lot of requests from the community, since the last version of Code Notes, you have the possibility to synchronize your GitHub gists (secret or public) directly from [Code Notes](https://lauthieb.github.io/code-notes). By simply giving the access token, you are ready to find your Gists on the application, modify them or create new ones!

## Create & update several snippets in 1 note 📝

In february 2018, when [Code Notes](https://lauthieb.github.io/code-notes) was launched, many developers asked me if it was possible to group several snippets in one note. This idea was great and I implemented it directly!

## Big comfort & linting 😍

If there is anything nice in [Code Notes](https://lauthieb.github.io/code-notes), it's this way of writing these notes as if we were in an IDE. Thanks to brace, you benefit from linting and an irreproachable writing comfort!

## Copy to clipboard 📎

Of course, in order to prevent you from selecting all your snippet, a small button "copy to clipboard" is there for you next to your snippet's name 👋
